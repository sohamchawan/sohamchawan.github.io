Another method where alkene with syn elimination is obtained pyrolysis of acetate ester.

            <strong> When benzene or substituted benzene is treated with alkyl chloride (R-Cl), alky bezene forms and reaction is known as Friedel Craft Alkylation. Similarly, if benzene or substituted benzene is treated with acid chloride (RCOCl) or acid anhydride (carboxylic acid with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), acylbenzene forms (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COCl) an aromatic ketone. The reaction is known as Friedel craft acylation. Fridel Crafts reactions are not given by benzene rings connected with meta directors (deactivated rings). Aniline does not give Friedel Crafts rection as N of aniline forms a complex with Lewis acid used in reaction. The limitation associated with Friedel Crafts acyalation is if alkyl group of acid chloride is tertiary then acylenium ion breaks into tertiary carbocation and CO and this way tertiary alkyl benzene form which undergoes further acylation (para position).</strong><br>

        <p class="image-text">
            <strong>This reaction is decarboxylative bromination of silver carboxylates. When silver salt of carboxylic acid is heated with Br<sub>2</sub> in dry CCl4 an alkyl bromide is formed with evolution of CO2. The reaction is step down reaction where product possess one carbon less than the starting substrate. The reaction follows free radical mechanism where first acyloxy then alkyl free radical is formed. We can take Carboxylic acid and HgO in place of silver carboxylate to get the same product. Please note When iodine is the reagent, a 1:1 ratio (RCOOAg:I<sub>2</sub>) gives alkyl iodide but if the ratio is 2:1 (RCOOAg:I<sub>2</sub>) then ester(RCOOR) is formed instead of alkyl iodide. The reaction is called Simonini reaction. The same product is obtained with carboxylic salt of Pb.</strong><br>

            <strong>(45) Elimination Reactions</strong>
        </h4>

        <p class="image-text">
            <strong> A reaction which involves removal of two atoms or groups from same molecule (carbene or nitrene forms). In alpha elimination (1,1) two atoms/groups are lost from same atom, in beta (1,2) elimination two atoms/groups are lost from adjacent atoms of the substrate (multiple bonds form). Dehydration of alcohols (refer reagent H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and dehydrohalogenation (refer reagent NaOH) are two important examples of beta elimination. Elimination reactions generally follow E<sub>1</sub> (first order), E<sub>2</sub> (second order), E<sub>i</sub> or E&lt;<sub>1CB</sub> (second order) mechanisms. If reagent is strong base like OH-, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O- it favours E<sub>2</sub> and (also favours E<sub>1CB</sub> if beta H is acidic). For both E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub> reactivity of substrate favours as 3<sup>o</sup>>2<sup>o</sup>>1<sup>o</sup>. Alpha alkyl or alpha aryl groups stabilise the carbocation character of Transition State (T.S) so favours E<sub>1</sub>, Beta aryl groups favour E<sub>1CB</sub>. Please note whatever be the mechanism a double bond does not go to a bridge head carbon unless sizes are large enough (8 or more). Newly double bond favours if it is in conjugation with C=C or C=O. In cyclohexane elimination is possible from diaxial conformation, if more stable conformer participates in elimination, then rate will be more. If the substrate has more than one beta H then double bond is formed at different locations. More substituted alkene (Saytzeff or Zaitsev&#8217;s product) will be more stable and major in most cases. Least substituted alkene is called Hofmann\&#8217;s product. Compounds containing charged nucleofugal leaving group (e.g. -N<sup>+</sup>R<sub>3</sub>, -S<sup>+</sup>R<sub>2</sub>) follow hoffmann elimination, for alkyl halides Hofmann product increases from I to F but major in F only (due to carbanion character in transition state). Hofmann elimination also increases with increase in branching in base (Me<sub>3</sub>C-O-).</strong><br>

            <strong>(46) Substitution Reactions</strong>
        </h4>

        <p class="image-text">
            <strong>An atom or group is replaced by another atom or group. Substitution reactions effected by nucleophiles are called nucleophilic substitution (different mechanisms are SN<sub>1</sub> i.e., first order, SN<sub>2</sub> i.e., second order or SN<sub>i</sub> i.e., second order. In SN<sub>1</sub> carbocation forms as intermediate and product forms with retention as well as inversion (predominant) i.e., partial racemisation. In SN<sub>2</sub> reaction nucleophile attacks from backside so inversion occurs in the product but we can&#8217;t say if reactant is dextro or R then product can be dextro as well as leavo means R or S depending upon group replaced. For SN<sub>2</sub> reactivity of different substrate generally varies as RCOCH<sub>2</sub>Cl > RNHCH<sub>2</sub>Cl > ROCH<sub>2</sub>Cl > C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl = CH<sub>3</sub>Cl > CH<sub>2</sub>=CH-CH<sub>2</sub>Cl > Me<sub>2</sub>CHCl > Me<sub>3</sub>CCl. For SN<sub>1</sub> the reactivity generally varies as RNHCH<sub>2</sub>Cl > ROCH<sub>2</sub>Cl > Ph<sub>2</sub>CH-Cl> Me<sub>3</sub>C-Cl > PhCH<sub>2</sub>Cl > Me<sub>2</sub>C-Cl > MeCl. If leaving group (e.g., Halogen) is attached to vinylic carbon or phenyl or bridgehead carbon then reactivity will be low for both SN<sub>1</sub> and SN<sub>2</sub>. Generally weak nucleophiles like H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>3</sub>OH favour SN<sub>1</sub> and strong nucleophiles like C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O- favour SN<sub>2</sub>. Polar protic solvents like H<sub>2</sub>O favour SN<sub>1</sub> because reactivity of nucleophile decreases and stability of carbocation increases in polar protic solvent by solvation. In many substitution reactions a nucleophilic group within a molecule close to the electrophilic carbon participates temporarily in the reaction to control both rate and stereochemistry. Such involvement of a group is known as neighbouring group participation (NGP) and rate enhancement is known as anchimeric assistance. Halobenzenes do not undergo normal SN<sub>1</sub> and SN<sub>2</sub> substitution but if they have one or more electron withdrawing groups such as -NO<sub>2</sub>, -CHO, -CN etc. at ortho or para positions then can undergo substitution under milder conditions (SN<sub>Ar</sub> mechanism) to form ipso product (nucleophile is attached with same carbon from where leaving group leaves) with reactivity order ArF > ArCl > ArBr > ArI. But if aryl halides have no activating electron withdrawing groups then benzyne mechanism is possible with strong base NaNH<sub>2</sub>, here ipso and cine (substitution at different position &#8211; adjacent) products possible with reactivity order ArI > ArBr > ArCl > ArF.</strong><br>
